    "Looking at the Fairbanks script, these are the fields that are necessary to do the benchmarking:\n",
    "\n",
    "'Site ID':  This was a 4 letter code identifying the particular facility.  It doesn't have to be a 4-letter code for ARIS, just some unique ID.  \n",
    "'From':  The start date of the billing period.  Any date format works.  \n",
    "'Thru':  The end date of the billing period.  This could be multiple months after the start date in the case of oil or propane.  \n",
    "'Service Name': This was ['Oil #1', 'Oil #2', 'Electricity', 'Steam', 'Natural Gas', 'Water', 'Sewer', 'Refuse'] for FNSB.  \n",
    "'Item Description':  This was the description of the particular line item on the bill, like \"Customer Charge\", \"Cost Adjustments\", \"Demand Charge\" plus a very wide variety of other types of charges.  In the script, I combined all the miscellaneous charges into \"Other Charge\".  These were billing line items that had no Usage associated with them.  \n",
    "'Usage': For usage-based charges, like kWh, kW, gallons, etc, this contains the usage.  For \"Other Charges\" (fixed charges), this is blank.  \n",
    "'Cost': $ cost of the line item.  \n",
    "'Units': For Usage based charges, the units.  These are what was in the Fairbanks data:  'Gallons', 'kWh', 'klbs', 'lbs', 'MMBtu', 'kVAR', 'kW', 'CCF', 'kVARh', 'Loads', 'Cgallons', 'kGal', 'Tons'.    \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we can get the ARIS data into this format, and if we could keep Service Name, Units, and some of the Item Descriptions the same, the script should run.  As far as Item descriptions that need to stay the same, I think it is just peak Electric Demand that  needs to be labeled like Fairbanks.  It can be any one of the following:  'KW Charge', 'On peak demand', 'Demand Charge'\n"

    "## To Do\n",
    "\n",
    "* Standardize values in each field to match FNSB values\n",
    "* Think more about how long of a billing period is too long.\n",
    "* Should check the Meter Read Date Field instead of always assuming the 15th.\n",
    "* Split `Other_Building_Data.xlsx` into separate Building Excel file and Fuel Types Excel file.\n",
    "* Auto-generate the Building Excel file from the API data.  Map \"Building Usage Name\" to \"Primary Function\", and \"Building Owner Name\" to \"Site Category\".\n",
    "    * Map each Zip to a Degree-Day site.\n",
    "    * Document the Zip-to-DD_site file.  Tell people that Zip code is needed to determine degree-day site.  Have them look in Buildings.xlsx file to see if a Degree-day site was assigned.\n",
    "* Add a README.md in the Data directory to explain what the files are.\n",
    "* Update the main README.md.\n",
    "* Add a section to the Settings File to accomodate ARIS passwords/URL and other ARIS specific settings.\n",
    "* Incorporate new graphs into the `benchmark.py` script, including creation of new Template."
